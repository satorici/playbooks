  name: WAScan ((W)eb (A)pplication (Scan)ner) is a Open Source web application security scanner. It is designed to find various vulnerabilities using "black-box" method, that means it won't study the source code of web applications but will work like a fuzzer, scanning the pages of the deployed web application, extracting links and forms and attacking the scripts, sending payloads and looking for error messages,..etc. 
  #example: satori run satori://web/wascan.yml --data='{"URL":"satori.ci"}' --output
