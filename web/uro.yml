  name: Using a URL list for security testing can be painful as there are a lot of URLs that have uninteresting/duplicate content; uro aims to solve that.
  #example: satori run satori://web/uro.yml --data='{"URL":"satori.ci"}' --output

uro:
  assertReturnCode: 0
  install:
    - pip3 install uro
  help:
    - uro -h
  url:
    - echo ${{URL}} > urls.txt
  run:
    - cat urls.txt | uro
