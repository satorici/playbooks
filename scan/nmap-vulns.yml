  description: "Nmap is a highly powerful network scanning tool with a variety of options for different scanning methods and output formats. While it does have some vulnerability scanning capabilities, especially when used with the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE), it is not a dedicated vulnerability scanning tool like Nessus or OpenVAS. Nevertheless, it can still provide valuable information about potential vulnerabilities on a network."
