  name: Hello and Bye Test
  description: "This playbook is designed to test the output of two commands to ensure it contains the phrase **Hello World**. It defines a single test named `test`, which includes an assertion and two sets of commands. The assertion, `assertStdoutContains: Hello World`, checks that the standard output from the executed commands contains the string **Hello World**.\n\nThe playbook defines two command blocks: `hello` and `bye`. The `hello` block executes the command `echo Hello ${{WHO}}`, which prints **Hello** followed by the value of the `WHO` variable. Similarly, the `bye` block executes the command `echo Bye ${{WHO}}`, printing **Bye** followed by the value of the `WHO` variable. The `WHO` variable is a placeholder that is provided during the playbook execution.\n\nFor example, if `WHO` is set to **World**, the commands will output *Hello World* and *Bye World*. Since *Hello World* is part of the output, the assertion will pass, verifying that the output contains the desired phrase.\n\n## Example\n\n`satori run satori://test.yml --data='{\"WHO\":\"World\"}' --report --output`"
